## About Mini Self-Data Analysis (Thanksgiving Edition)

`Mini Self-Data Analysis (Thanksgiving Edition)` is an exploratory data analysis project that tracked various metrics against my energy and happiness levels every hour for the whole week leading up to Thanksgiving Break.

My goal is to determine whether any of these various had an impact on my energy and happiness levels. **Finalized findings are located in the report.doc file!**

Analysis is broken up into 7 large categories with smaller metrics within:
- Time/General (8a - 12a)
    - Time of day / per hour
    - Day of the week
- Binary (Y/N)
    - Within last hour, did I...
        - Eat?
        - Shower?
        - Snack?
        - Listen to music?
- Rating (1-5)
    - Level of hydration
    - Level of caffeine
    - Amount of non-work-related interaction with friends
    - Amount of non-work-related interaction with partner
- Discrete (0-60)
    - Minutes spent on break (nearest 5 minutes)
    - Minutes spent on exercise (nearest 5 minutes)
- Continuous
    - Temperature
- Categorical
    - Type of weather
    - Main type of activity

Intended to be a pre-cursory analysis for a more ambitious, year-long data project.
